- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @earnshae.
- ðŸ‘´ I have professionally used over 20 programming languages in my career.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently playing with Python, React, Node.js/Cordova/Ionic Apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redis, Celery, and RabbitMQ.
- ðŸ’­ I think I will play with go next.

I started this account as I wanted to play arround with the scryfall (https://scryfall.com/) API and I thought others might be interested in some of code/methods.

I'll post up a couple of repos showing you what I come up with. You tell me what you think.
